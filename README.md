# PhotoSharingApp
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app sample demonstrating real-world social media experiences around photo sharing. With this app, users can earn virtual gold by uploading and sharing photos with people from all around the world. They can upload photos  compete against other users. Are their photos a gold source? Are they among the most generous contributors? They can find out on the app's leaderboard.



**Goal of PhotoSharingApp** is to provide a complete, end-to-end example of a real-world app that uses a variety of UWP features, and exhibits design and development best practices. This makes it a great source of code you can copy into your own apps. It also provides an example of what a real-world app architecture might look like. The decoupled architecture makes it easy to reuse code or to make changes and build your own photo sharing app, which you can then publish in the [Windows Store](http://dev.windows.com).


## PhotoSharingApp features

The app allows users to:
- Browse photo categories 
- Navigate into photo collections and photo details.
- Capture photos
- Upload photos directly in the app or upload an existing photo.
- Give gold (app's so-called currency)
- Add comments to photos uploaded by other users.
- Receive push notifications when users are given gold for uploaded photos.
- Explore a leaderboard of users with the most gold, 
- Users that gave the most gold to other photos
- Photos that received the most gold.
- Sign in with a Microsoft, Facebook, Google, or Twitter account.
- Report content.
- Buy virtual gold (using in-app purchase).




## Requirements
- Well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience.

- Uses local/roaming storage for storing data and/or settings that are necessary for or enhance this user experience.

- Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices (Accelerometer, gyroscope, location services, sound, network service (connect to server for data), camera, multi touch gestures)

- More than a simple information app and be interactive as part of the design
